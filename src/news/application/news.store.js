/**
 * Reactive application store for the News bounded context.
 *
 * Acts as the single point of truth for news-related state in the
 * presentation layer. It orchestrates the following use cases:
 *
 * - **Load sources**: Fetches all available news sources via {@link NewsApi}
 *   and assembles them into {@link Source} domain entities.
 * - **Select source**: Sets the active source and triggers an automatic
 *   article refresh.
 * - **Load articles**: Fetches top-headline articles for the currently
 *   selected source and assembles them into {@link Article} domain entities.
 *
 * All infrastructure interactions are delegated to the gateway and assembler
 * classes, keeping the store free from HTTP and serialisation concerns.
 *
 * @type {object}
 * @property {Source[]}  sources        - Ordered list of all available news sources.
 * @property {Article[]} articles       - Articles published by the currently selected source.
 * @property {Error[]}   errors         - Accumulated errors from failed API calls.
 * @property {Source|null} currentSource - The news source currently selected by the user.
